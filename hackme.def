HACK ME

Each user registers first.
A list of registered users and their online status is displayed in the lobby.
The list is ordered by rank, which is based on all-time score.
A user can challenge another user.
A user can choose to be automatically paired with another user.


TURN BASED MODE

Each user chooses how long they want both users to have for writing their code. The average between both users' choice is then chosen.
Each user writes code which will be executed on the oponent's side when time is up.


REAL TIME MODE

Each user writes code and sends it to be executed on the oponent's side whenever the user wants.


PROPOSED GOALS

Cause a freeze without using cheaty methods (e.g. "while(true);").
Find and call a particular win function named and/or hidden by the oponent.


MECHANISM

The game's arena can be inside an iframe, to enable complete isolation from the game's UI. Possibly "about:blank", with injections from top window.
